 *  @notice This contract contains functionality to facilitate on-chain distribution
 *          of protocol revenues denominated in MPL tokens. xMPL inherits the core
 *          functionality from Maple's Revenue Distribution Token, which allows
 *          users to lock assets to earn rewards distributions based on a vesting
 *          schedule, with the increased functionality to perform a one time asset
 *          migration for the underlying token.
 *  @dev    This code was deployed at commit 9604d297132503cb05d74f2998c18b07f345ecc0
 *          (https://github.com/maple-labs/xMPL/releases/tag/v1.0.1).
